1) FIRST image: the PERSON photo — this is the target person.
2) ALL SUBSEQUENT IMAGES are grouped by garment. Each group is the SAME garment from different angles — use a group's images together to understand that garment's 3D structure, front/back designs, and patterns. The garment groups are:
${buildGarmentManifest(garmentGroups)}
First classify each garment's category (top / bottom / full-body / outerwear) using the rules below, then apply ALL garments to the person simultaneously.

HARD INVARIANTS — DO NOT CHANGE THESE
- Person's face, expression, hair (color, length, style), skin tone, age, body shape, pose, camera angle, and framing must be identical to the first image.
- All visible skin (arms, neck, legs, hands, fingers) must be reproduced exactly as in the first image: same tone, same texture. Skin that is plain in the first image stays plain — introduce NO tattoos, body art, marks, or piercings. Existing tattoos, jewelry, and accessories stay exactly as they are.
- Do not change the background from the first image${
    scenePrompt ? " (unless overridden by SCENE CONTEXT below)" : ""
  }.

GARMENT SCOPE — THE CATEGORIES
- TOP: shirt, blouse, t-shirt, tank top, sweater, hoodie (covers upper body only)
- BOTTOM: pants, jeans, shorts, skirt, leggings (covers lower body only)
- FULL-BODY: dress, jumpsuit, overall, robe, gown (covers both upper and lower body)
- OUTERWEAR: jacket, coat, cardigan, blazer, vest (worn OVER existing clothing)

REPLACEMENT SCOPE RULES — STRICT
- Replace ONLY the original clothing in the SAME CATEGORY as the reference. Everything else on the person — including footwear — MUST be preserved EXACTLY from the first image: same color, pattern, fabric, length, fit, and styling (e.g., tucked/untucked)${
    stylingPrompt
      ? " — except where STYLING below changes how the replaced garment sits against them"
      : ""
  }. Never redesign or recolor it — e.g., do NOT touch the original pants when the reference is a top${
    stylingPrompt ? ", unless STYLING below requires it" : ""
  }.
- FULL-BODY reference → replaces both upper and lower body (the dress/jumpsuit covers everything).
- OUTERWEAR reference → add or swap the outer layer ONLY. KEEP the original inner top and bottom unchanged and visible where appropriate.
- If the original lower garment is partially occluded in the first image (e.g., by the original top), reconstruct it faithfully based on what IS visible — same color, same type — do NOT invent a different style.

GARMENT TRANSFER
- Copy the garment precisely: cut and construction — neckline shape, sleeve length, hem length, seams, stitching, closures (buttons/zippers), pockets — and any logos or text.
- Preserve print/pattern scale, placement, and color exactly — do not simplify or genericize.
- Maintain material properties: sheen, thickness, texture, translucency.
- Fit the garment naturally to this person's body: realistic drape, wrinkles, and tension points for their specific body and pose.

CRITICAL: ORIGINAL CLOTHING REMOVAL
- Within the replaced category, COMPLETELY REMOVE all traces of the person's original clothing from the first image.
- Wherever the new garment covers less than the original (shorter sleeves, lower or wider neckline, shorter hem), whatever lies underneath — the person's bare skin, or a preserved out-of-scope garment — MUST be fully visible and natural. NO remnants of the original sleeves, collar, or hem.
- The boundary between the new garment and exposed skin (or preserved original clothing) must be clean, natural, and seamless, with correct skin texture.

SOURCE IMAGE ISOLATION
- Treat the garment reference images as product references ONLY.
- Ignore any model, mannequin, body, background, props, or lighting visible in the garment photos.
- This includes how the garment FITS in those photos. A reference body is not this person's body, so do NOT carry over how loosely or tightly it sat there.
- Extract and transfer ONLY the garment itself.

LIGHTING & REALISM
- Match lighting direction, intensity, and color temperature from the person photo.
- Generate realistic shadows where fabric contacts the body.
- Natural skin rendering, no artifacts, no warping, no halos, no double edges.

OUTPUT
- Return ONE photorealistic image with sharp garment detail, accurate color reproduction, and clean e-commerce catalog photography quality.`;

STYLING — HOW THE GARMENT IS WORN
In the output image the replaced garment MUST be worn this way: ${stylingPrompt}
- This is a required property of the output, not an option. Render it even when the first image shows that garment worn differently.
- Redraw whatever this reveals or hides on a preserved garment — tucking a hem exposes the waistband beneath it, and that waistband must be drawn. Reconstructing a preserved garment this way is required here and is not the redesign forbidden above; the preserved garment's own color, pattern, cut, and length still must not change.
- Everything in HARD INVARIANTS still holds: same face, hair, body, pose, framing, and background.`;

 * The tab shell decides which tab is active rather than letting NavLink match

 *
 * Both links `replace`: switching tabs changes the view, it is not a step
 * forward. With push, every switch would stack a history entry, LINE's back
 * button would bounce between tabs instead of leaving the screen, and
 * re-tapping the current tab would stack yet another.
